# Land-Use-Land-Cover-Classification-of-Satellite-Images-using-Deep-Learning
This work discusses how high resolution satellite images are classified into various classes like cloud, vegetation, water and miscellaneous, using feed forward neural network. Open source python libraries like GDAL and keras were used in this work. This work is generic and can be used for satellite images of any resolution, but with MX band sensors. 

Intially, the raw extracted satellite image has lots of distortions like gemetrical, radiometric etc. We process these images,
